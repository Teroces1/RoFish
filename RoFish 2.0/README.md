This is RoFish 2.0, the engine I am currently working on. I am using more efficient algorithms to speed it up and make it stronger, and I am expecting it to be several magnitudes better than the previous version.

I am going to be using similar method names/ parameters to keep compatability with systems that use the old engine.
